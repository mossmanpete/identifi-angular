        <h3>About Identifi</h3>
        <p class="lead">
          Identifi is a social networking application that stores everything on its users' devices which communicate directly with each other &mdash; no corporate gatekeepers needed.
        </p>
        <h4>Public messaging</h4>
        <p>It's a bit like Tw****r.</p>

        <h4>Web of trust</h4>
        <p>You can create new Identifi accounts (technically: cryptographic keypairs) at will, without asking for anyone's permission, but only the users whose <b>web of trust</b> upvoted your account will see its posts.</p>

        <p>When you upvote someone, they become your 1st degree contact. The accounts they upvoted become 2nd degree contacts. Then there are 3rd degree contacts and so on. This is the web of trust, which can be used to filter all content on Identifi. Hiding users by downvoting is also possible.</p>

        <p><b>This way we can avoid spam and other unwanted content without giving power to central moderators.</b></p>

        <p>You can also add to your contacts list and rate people and organizations who are not yet on Identifi.</p>

        <p>A decentralized web of trust, unlike certain big brother systems, could be a strong positive social force as envisioned in the blog post <a href="https://medium.com/@mmalmi/learning-to-trust-strangers-167b652a654f">Learning to Trust Strangers</a>.</p>

        <h4>Identity verifications</h4>
        <p>Keep your contact details up-to-date and ask for verifications from peers or specialized verifiers trusted by your WoT. Use your Identifi account for online authentication or identification on services that support it.</p>

        <p>If you lose access to your account (keypair), just create a new one and link it to your existing identity by asking for verifications from your web of trust.</p>

        <h4>Privacy</h4>
        <p>It's important to remember that as for now, <b>everything you post on Identifi is public</b>.</p>
        <p>Private chat between users will probably be implemented at some point, and other user permissions and groups maybe later.</p>

        <h4>Technology</h4>
        <p>
          Identifi uses <a href="https://gun.eco">GUN</a> for indexing and <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> for messages, images and other static data.
        </p>

        <p>Identifi is free and open source software. The project is in alpha development stage. <b>Contributions welcome!</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/identifi/identifi">Source code</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/identifi/identifi-lib/b979abf6/example/browser.html">Technical description of Identifi with live code</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Future tech</h5>
        <p>
          Currently the weak point of Identifi's decentralization is the list of initial peers, which could easily be blocked by governments or ISPs. By default, the application connects to IPFS default peers and a couple GUN peers. You can always add peers manually on the <a ui-sref="settings">settings page</a>, but that is cumbersome for the average user.
        </p>

        <p>
          We already have a multicast module prototype for GUN which can find peers on the same local area network. Bluetooth modules are not yet implemented, but will enable a network of peers that need to meet each other only occasionally.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the wide area network level, Identifi trusted contacts could exchange network addresses privately to avoid having them blocked or tracked. WebRTC's NAT traversal capabilities can enable direct connections between typical network endpoint users, but you still need a firewall-opened/port-forwarded rendez-vous node for them, and in some cases a relay node.
